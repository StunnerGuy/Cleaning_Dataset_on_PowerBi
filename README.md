# Cleaning_Dataset_on_PowerBi

## INTRODUCTION
Data cleaning, also known as data cleansing or data scrubbing, is the process of identifying and correcting or removing errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in a dataset. 
It involves transforming raw data into a clean and reliable format for analysis. 



## TASK 
1. Import CSV DATASET ‘employees’ into  Power BI Desktop using the csv file option
2. Clean data and get it ready for analysis using Power Query
3. Export back to PowerBI Cleaned



## EXECUTION
Here is a Correllation shewing steps and stages of my cleaning process
Fig 1. Shows the options used to perform a CSV import, featuring varieties of other options.
A preview of the "employee"data set is also shown here.

## Some Adjustments Made
1. Changes were made to the headers, they were named and adjusted to make more sense.
2. The Names colum was also re-touched to look better and to serve its purpose in just one glance.
3. The Gender column was also modified.
4. The date colums was modified too, for simplicity and consistency.
5. Index Column was added for more simplicity at glance.

__PS: Looking at Fig 3a, we were able to verify on Power Query that Our data was clean, with valid entries without any error.__
